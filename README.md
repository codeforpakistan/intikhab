## 🔐 How Homomorphic Encryption Works

Intikhab uses **Paillier Homomorphic Encryption** to achieve verifiable elections without compromising voter privacy:

### Encryption Process
1. **Key Generation**: Each election generates a unique public/private key pair
2. **Vote Encryption**: Individual votes are encrypted using the public key
3. **Homomorphic Addition**: Encrypted votes can be mathematically combined
4. **Result Decryption**: Only the final tally is decrypted, never individual votes

### Security Guarantees
- **Ballot Secrecy**: Individual votes remain encrypted and untraceable
- **Verifiable Results**: Mathematical proofs ensure accurate counting
- **Tamper Resistance**: Encrypted votes cannot be altered without detection
- **Zero-Knowledge Verification**: Results can be verified without revealing votes

### Technical Implementation
```python
# Simplified encryption flow
vote = candidate_selection
encrypted_vote = paillier_encrypt(vote, public_key)
vote_total = homomorphic_add(all_encrypted_votes)
final_result = paillier_decrypt(vote_total, private_key)
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Election Integrity
